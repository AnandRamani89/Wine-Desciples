[ec2-user@domU-12-31-39-0C-70-2C ~]$ htpasswd -cm/etc/svn-auth-users winedesciples
Usage:
        htpasswd [-cmdpsD] passwordfile username
        htpasswd -b[cmdpsD] passwordfile username password

        htpasswd -n[mdps] username
        htpasswd -nb[mdps] username password
 -c  Create a new file.
 -n  Don't update file; display results on stdout.
 -m  Force MD5 encryption of the password (default).
 -d  Force CRYPT encryption of the password.
 -p  Do not encrypt the password (plaintext).
 -s  Force SHA encryption of the password.
 -b  Use the password from the command line rather than prompting for it.
 -D  Delete the specified user.
On other systems than Windows, NetWare and TPF the '-p' flag will probably not work.
The SHA algorithm does not use a salt and is less secure than the MD5 algorithm.
[ec2-user@domU-12-31-39-0C-70-2C ~]$ svn
Type 'svn help' for usage.
[ec2-user@domU-12-31-39-0C-70-2C ~]$ svn help

on the directories.  If no arguments are supplied to such a
command, it recurses on the current directory (inclusive) by default.
